# Research Agenda
Ongoing Research Agenda for "Tiruvadi Lab"

## Overview
My efforts focus on a general framework for doing clinically-relevant scientific research - namely _reverse clinical engineering_.
I do this across several domains: neuro, medicine, and law being the main ones.

## Deep Brain Stimulation
* Antidepressant DBS
  * Limitations of Measurement
    - [X] $Z_\Delta$ in MC
    - [ ] RO Limitations
    - [ ] PAC Design
    - [ ] PAC-SINDy
  * Linking Brain and Behavior
    - [ ] DR-SCC
    - [ ] FS-DR-SCC
  * Linking Stim and Brain Response
    - [ ] NA-SCCwm + SVM
    - [ ] Large-scale Kmo Link
  * Linking Stim and Brain Dynamics
    - [X] DO Intro + SINDy
    - [ ] DO w/ Models (Delay, KMo, WC$\pm$Delay)
* Generalized DBS
  * Control-Affine Models
  * Control Theoretic Frameworks
 
## Principles
* Small, not Big, Data
* Reverse Engineering from What Matters
* Bring Math to Intuition, Don't Erase Intuition with Models
* Geometry, Symmetry, and Dynamics Have Analytical Primacy
* Don't be Afraid to Act

### Details

#### Bridging Big and Small Data
* Big Data Approaches to Clinical Neuroscience - distilling invariants
* Small Data Approaches to Clinical Neuroscience - reinforcing intuition
* Structure-Constrained Dynamics Predictions

#### Geometry of Delays
* Delay Embeddings/Takens
* Delay Circuits
* Delay Differential Eqs
* Geometry of Delay

#### Control Affine on Behavior
* Base Model for CA-DBS

* MPC for DBS as Ctrl-Affine

#### MPC + Reverse-Engineering
* As an approach to inference
* Small Data Inference
* Implementing RE in Medicine

#### Emotion in AI
* Tools for Control Theory in Affective DBS
* AI for Model Predictive Control
* Affective AI
* Emotion and Cognition
