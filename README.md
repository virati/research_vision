# Research Vision
My (Vineet Tiruvadi) Vision for my Research Efforts.

## Overview
My focus is on Applied Control Theory, primarily in Medical Contexts.

Building on Neuroengineering foundations, my efforts are broadening to better study *small-data*, *intuition-driven*, and *patient-centric* health.

### Technical Approaches
At a technical level, my focus is on building _control theoretic frameworks_ informed by full-stack medical expertise, and then using AI/ML to instantiate tools within those frameworks.

Importantly, I think we can do excellent **science along the way** as we improve patient lives in the here-and-now.

Perhaps uniquely, I also think we have an obligation to improve patient lives through any and all avenues available - not just clinical medicine but broader, system-level interventions.
This allows us to build both effective interventions **and** broad-system models of real-world processes.
